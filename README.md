# tilebased\_elevation.js
tilebased\_elevation.js is a javascript wrapper that provides simple and efficient read-out
of elevation values at arbitrarily defined points for services like Mapbox that only
provide an elevation API for accessing data in the form of raster tiles.

## Motivation
I needed elevation data for a project in 2020, and after a quick search I found
several options:

* Google Elevation API:
    * $4-5 per 1000 requests
    * Max 500,000 requests per month
    * Max 100 requests per second
    * Max 512 locations per request (but somtimes you need one location right now, which would count as a whole request)
    * 10 m resolution
* Open-Elevation Public API
    * Free
    * 250 m resolution
    * Only covers -56째 < latitude < 60째
* Elevation-API (elevation-api.io)
    * 5 km resolution (free)
    * 5-30 m resolution for $0.2 per 1000 requests
    * Max 33 requests per second
    * Max 10 locations per request

So basically one had to choose between horrible resolution or paying per request.
However, I already had a free mapbox account, and it turns out that mapbox also provides
elevation data, just in the form of tile data rather than as a simple text API. Here's
what that looks like in comparison:

* Mapbox elevation API
    * Free
    * Max 50,000 page sessions per month
    * Unlimited elevation tiles per session
    * 5 m resolution (configurable - default is 40 m)
    * Hard to use

Aside from the hard to use part, it looked much better than the stanard options.
So all I needed was a wrapper that would mek this API just as easy to use as the others.
tilebased\_elevation.js is an attempt at this.

## Usage
tilebased\_elevation.js depends on Leaflet for describing the projection of the tiles,
so it must be loaded first. The usage itself is very simple. Just initialize an api
object using the tilebasedElevation constructor, providing the tile path and api key,
and then use the `.get()` function to query it asynchronously. Here's a stand-alone usage
example:

```html
<script src=leaflet.js></script>
<script src=tilebased_elevation.js></script>
<script>
	var api = tilebasedElevation("https://api.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.terrain-rgb/{z}/{x}/{y}.pngraw?access_token=[YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY]");
	// Get a single elevation, and print it to the console
	api.get([29.8,83.6]).then(el => console.log(el));
	// Get elevations for a line of 100,000 points in India/Himalaya/China/Russia starting from lat = 18째 and ending at
	// lat = 59째
	var points = [];
	for(var i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
		points.push([18.0+i*4e-4,83.6])
	api.get(points).then(els => console.log(els);
	// Or you can use it with await if you're in an async function
	// els = await api.get(points);
</script>
```

The full syntax for the constructor is `tilebasedElevation(url, opts)`, where opts is a dictionary
with the following options:

* zoom: The resolution of the elevation tiles queried. Defaults to 12, corresponding to a resolution of 40 m at the equator. The maximum meaningful value is 15, which results in 5 m resolution. Higher values typically mean that more tiles need to be loaded when you ask for points covering a wide area, so there is a resolution/speed tradeoff.
* cacheSize: The number of tiles to cache tiles internally. Defaults to 100. Uses tileSize\*tileSize\*4 = 0.25 MB of memory per tile.
* decoder: The function used to decode the raw RGB data in the images to elevation values. Defaults to `function(R,G,B,A) { return -10000 + ((R * 256 * 256 + G * 256 + B) * 0.1); }`, which is appropriate for MapBox elevation data.
* crs: The projection used for the tiles. Defaults to L.CRS.EPSG3857 (Web-Mercator). You probably won't need to change this.
* tileSize: The size of each tile, in pixels. Defaults to 256, which is the standard for Web-Mercator maps.
